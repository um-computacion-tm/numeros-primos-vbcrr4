# Prime Number Program

This is a simple Python program that determines whether a given number is prime or not.

## Functionality

The main functionality of the program is in the `es_primo(value)` function. This function takes an integer `value` as input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

The program also includes unit tests (`TestSumadeprimos`) to verify the correct operation of the `es_primo()` function for various test cases, including prime and non-prime numbers.
